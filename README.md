# Fast solver for linear diophantine equations

This is an implementation of Contejean and Devie's algorithm for solving linear
dioaphantine equations.

I am interested in this problem for [unification modulo associativity and
commutativity](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747717187800044),
which seems to be a common use case of linear diophantine equations solvers.
