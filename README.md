# Fast solver for linear diophantine equations

This is an implementation of Contejean and Devie's algorithm for solving linear
dioaphantine equations.

I am interested in this problem for unification modulo associativity and
commutativity, which seems to be a common use case of linear diophantine
equations solvers.
